### Golden Ratio Link Distribution

## Search Engine Optimization Architecture

### Page Hierarchy (SEO Value Distribution)

1. **Homepage** (Highest authority - distributes link equity)
2. **Service Landing Pages** (High authority - primary conversion pages)
3. **About/Process Pages** (Medium authority - trust and credibility)
4. **Case Studies** (Medium authority - social proof and long-tail keywords)
5. **Market Insights** (Variable authority - topical expertise and freshness)
6. **Contact/FAQ** (Lower authority - but essential for conversions)

### Keyword Architecture

- **Homepage**: Primary brand terms, "Puerto Rico real estate investment"
- **Services**: Service-specific terms + location modifiers
- **Case Studies**: Long-tail investment scenarios + location-specific terms
- **Market Insights**: Educational and informational search queries
- **About**: Trust and credibility terms, founder/company searches

### Schema Markup Implementation

```json
Organization Schema (Homepage):
{
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "Legs on the Ground",
  "url": "https://legsontheground.com",
  "description": "Puerto Rico real estate investment services",
  "areaServed": "Puerto Rico",
  "serviceType": ["Property Management", "Real Estate Investment", "Property Renovation"]
}

Service Schema (Service Pages):
{
  "@type": "Service",
  "serviceType": "Property Acquisition",
  "provider": "Legs on the Ground",
  "areaServed": "Puerto Rico",
  "hasOfferCatalog": {
    "@type": "OfferCatalog",
    "name": "Real Estate Investment Services"
  }
}

LocalBusiness Schema (Contact Pages):
{
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Legs on the Ground",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "addressCountry": "PR",
    "addressRegion": "Puerto Rico"
  }
}
```

## Accessibility Navigation Requirements

### WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance

- **Skip navigation** links for keyboard users
- **Landmark roles** for all major sections (main, nav, aside, footer)
- **Aria labels** for complex navigation structures
- **Focus management** for modal menus and overlays
- **Screen reader** friendly menu descriptions

### Keyboard Navigation

- **Tab order** follows logical reading sequence
- **Arrow key navigation** within mega menus
- **Escape key** closes modal menus
- **Enter/Space** activates menu items
- **Focus indicators** clearly visible on all interactive elements

### Mobile Accessibility

- **Touch targets** minimum 44px × 44px
- **Gesture alternatives** for all swipe/drag interactions
- **Voice navigation** compatible menu structure
- **Zoom support** up to 200% without horizontal scrolling

## Performance Optimization Architecture

### Critical Path Prioritization

1. **Above-the-fold content** loads first (Hero, Navigation)
2. **Primary CTAs** load before secondary content
3. **Service overview** prioritized over detailed descriptions
4. **Social proof** loads after primary content
5. **Footer content** loads last (non-critical)

### Progressive Enhancement Strategy

- **Core functionality** works without JavaScript
- **Enhanced interactions** layer on top of basic functionality
- **Visual enhancements** apply after core content loads
- **Analytics and tracking** load asynchronously
- **Third-party widgets** load after primary content

### Content Delivery Optimization

- **Images**: WebP format with fallbacks, responsive sizing
- **Fonts**: Preload critical fonts, subset non-critical fonts
- **CSS**: Critical CSS inline, non-critical CSS deferred
- **JavaScript**: Essential scripts priority, analytics deferred
- **Third-party content**: Lazy load maps, social widgets, chat systems

This information architecture provides a comprehensive foundation for the site structure, ensuring optimal user experience, search engine optimization, and accessibility compliance while maintaining the Golden Ratio design principles throughout the navigation and content organization.
