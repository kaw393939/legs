**Essential Extensions:**

- GitHub Copilot (AI assistance)
- GitLens (Git visualization)
- Prettier (Code formatting)
- Live Server (Local development)
- Markdown All in One (Documentation)

#### Magic Word: **Extension Ecosystem**

> Extensions transform VS Code from a text editor into a specialized development environment. Each extension adds capabilities that professional developers rely on daily.

```magic-word
Extension Ecosystem: A curated collection of VS Code extensions that work together to create a specialized development environment optimized for specific workflows and technologies.
```

- Live preview and testing
- Code formatting and quality

Can you recommend specific extensions and explain how each one contributes to a professional workflow? Also suggest optimal settings for team collaboration.
```

### Afternoon Session: Git Installation & Configuration

#### Git Global Configuration

Set up your professional Git identity:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Professional Name"
git config --global user.email "your.professional@email.com"
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
git config --global color.ui auto
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

#### Professional Git Aliases

Install time-saving aliases:

```bash
# Status and branch shortcuts
git config --global alias.st status
git config --global alias.br branch
git config --global alias.co checkout

# Commit shortcuts
git config --global alias.cm "commit -m"
git config --global alias.ca "commit -am"

# Advanced workflows for AI development
git config --global alias.save "!git add -A && git commit -m 'WIP: save current work'"
git config --global alias.undo "reset HEAD~1 --mixed"
```

### Day 1 Assignment: Environment Verification

1. Complete VS Code setup with all extensions
2. Configure Git with professional settings
3. Create test repository and make first commit
4. Screenshot your configured environment

---

## ðŸ“š Day 2: Git Fundamentals for AI Development

### Morning Session: Basic Git Workflow

#### Magic Word: **Atomic Commits**

> Each commit should represent one logical change that can be described in a single sentence. This makes code history readable and enables precise rollbacks.

```magic-word
Atomic Commits: Version control practice where each commit contains exactly one logical change, making the project history clean, understandable, and easy to navigate or revert.
```

#### The Professional Commit Cycle

```bash
# 1. Check current state
git status

# 2. Stage specific changes (not just "git add .")
git add src/components/Header.js

# 3. Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add responsive header component

- Implements mobile-first design approach
- Uses CSS Grid for flexible layout
- Includes ARIA labels for accessibility"

# 4. Push regularly to backup work
git push origin main
```

#### AI Prompt: Commit Message Generator

```prompt
I made changes to a web component that adds a responsive header to my website. The changes include:
- Mobile-first CSS design
- CSS Grid layout system
- Accessibility improvements with ARIA labels
- Integration with existing design system

Generate a professional commit message following conventional commit format that clearly explains what was changed and why it matters for the project.
```

### Afternoon Session: Git Safety Patterns

#### The Stash Workflow

```bash
# Need to switch contexts quickly?
git stash push -m "WIP: header responsive fixes in progress"

# Work on something else
git checkout -b hotfix/urgent-bug
# Make fixes, commit, push

# Return to original work
git checkout main
git stash pop
```

#### Magic Word: **Merge Conflicts**

> When Git can't automatically combine changes from different sources, requiring manual resolution to decide which changes to keep.

```magic-word
Merge Conflicts: Situations where Git cannot automatically combine changes from different branches or contributors, requiring manual resolution to determine which version of conflicting code to keep.
```

### Day 2 Assignment: Git Scenario Practice

1. Create feature branch with 3 atomic commits
2. Practice stash workflow with context switching
3. Simulate and resolve a merge conflict
4. Document your Git workflow in markdown

## ðŸ“š Day 3: Professional Development Practices

### Morning Session: Quality Standards

#### Code Review Checklist

Before each commit, verify:

- [ ] Code builds without errors
- [ ] Changes are focused and atomic
- [ ] Commit message follows convention
- [ ] No sensitive data included
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

#### Magic Word: **Conventional Commits**

> Standardized commit message format that makes project history readable by humans and parseable by tools for automation.

```magic-word
Conventional Commits: A specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages, enabling automated changelog generation and semantic versioning.
```

#### AI Prompt: Code Quality Reviewer

```prompt
I'm about to commit code changes to my project. Please review this checklist and suggest additional quality checks for professional web development:

Current checklist:
- Code builds without errors
- Atomic, focused changes
- Conventional commit message
- No sensitive data
- Updated documentation

What other quality standards should I check before committing? Consider security, performance, accessibility, and maintainability.
```

### Afternoon Session: Collaboration Workflows

#### Branch Naming Conventions

```
feature/user-authentication
fix/mobile-nav-bug
docs/api-documentation
style/golden-ratio-design
refactor/component-structure

## ðŸ“š Day 4: Git Crisis Management

### Morning Session: Recovery Techniques

#### The "Oh No, I Broke Everything" Flowchart

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Something Went Wrong] --> B{Can you see the problem?}
    B -->|Yes| C[git status]
    B -->|No| D[git reflog]
    C --> E{Staged changes?}
    E -->|Yes| F[git reset HEAD]
    E -->|No| G{Committed but wrong?}
    G -->|Yes| H[git reset --soft HEAD~1]
    G -->|No| I[git stash]
    D --> J[Find good commit]
    J --> K[git reset --hard SHA]
```

#### Magic Word: **Git Reflog**

> Complete history of every action taken in your repository, including deleted commits, providing a safety net for recovery operations.

```magic-word
Git Reflog: A record of when the tips of branches and other references were updated in the local repository, allowing recovery of seemingly lost commits and branches.
```

#### Recovery Scenarios Practice

**Scenario 1: Wrong Commit Message**

```bash
# Committed with typo in message
git commit --amend -m "feat: add correct header component"
```

**Scenario 2: Committed Too Early**

```bash
# Need to add more changes to last commit
git add forgotten-file.js
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

**Scenario 3: Committed to Wrong Branch**

```bash
# Move commits to correct branch
git log --oneline -3  # Note the SHA
git reset --hard HEAD~3  # Remove from current branch
git checkout correct-branch
git cherry-pick SHA1 SHA2 SHA3  # Add to correct branch
```

#### AI Prompt: Git Crisis Consultant

```prompt
I'm in a Git crisis! Here's what happened:

[Describe your specific situation]

I need step-by-step recovery instructions that:
1. Minimize data loss
2. Maintain clean project history
3. Don't break anything else
4. Follow professional best practices

Please provide the exact commands and explain what each one does so I can learn from this mistake.
```

### Afternoon Session: Advanced Workflows

#### Interactive Rebase for History Cleanup

```bash
# Clean up last 3 commits before pushing
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# In the editor:
# pick = keep commit as-is
# squash = combine with previous commit
# reword = change commit message
# edit = modify commit content
```

#### Magic Word: **Interactive Rebase**

> Git feature that allows rewriting commit history by combining, editing, or reordering commits before sharing them with others.

```magic-word
Interactive Rebase: Git command that opens an editor allowing you to modify commit history by reordering, combining, editing, or removing commits before they are shared publicly.
```

### Day 4 Assignment: Crisis Simulation

1. Create intentional Git "disasters"
2. Practice recovery techniques
3. Document your recovery process
4. Help classmate with their crisis scenario

# Before starting new work
git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name

# During development
git add specific-files
git commit -m "conventional: description"

# End of day (even if incomplete)
git push origin feature-branch

# When feature is complete
# Create pull request
# Code review
# Merge to main
```

#### AI Prompt: Workflow Optimizer
